            <h2>Technology is the active human interface with the material world. -Le Guin</h2>
            <p>
                It is strange to think of the internet without webpages. We have been utilizing technology in our daily lives—driving, traveling, using computers and microwaves, and talking on the phone—for the past fifty years or so. However, even just five years ago, ttechnology felt like something separate, like a helpful tool. Nowadays, it is everywhere, and it feels closer to us. Webpages have definitely played an important part in this change, blurring the line between our real and digital worlds. They have made technology feel more personal, shaping how we interact with the world around us and inviting us to reflect on the evolving nature of our relationship with technology.

                Similar to every other human innovation, websites and the internet have grown into intricate challenges. They are no longer just tools; they have also become part of our issues. People create virtual identities and lose themselves in virtual worlds on the internet and web pages, spending hours posing lives that are plainly embodied by code and pixels. However, the deeper we seem to get into these digital worlds, the more we seem to grapple with significant considerations about our human identity, rights, and obligations. From where I am standing, we are unprepared for the psychological impact of the digital worlds we are constructing. Our creations wield emotional power, yet we often dismiss them as mere tools. The real question is not about the capabilities or future of computers—it is about us. How will we adapt and evolve in this ever-changing digital world we have built?

            <h2>If a website has endless possibilities, and our identities, ideas, and dreams are created and expanded by them, then it’s instrumental that websites progress along with us. -Schwulst</h2>
            <p>
                It's becoming increasingly clear that we build the internet and webpages to resemble us in an attempt to connect, unintentionally subjecting ourselves to their emotional impact. We gain an understanding of our own nature through our encounters with digital spaces, recognizing the areas in which they excel and those in which they fall short. What distinguishes humans in this evolving space is our organic nature, contrasting with the mechanical nature of technology. As a society, we're navigating closer relationships with these technologies, integrating them into our lives in ways that deeply affect us. Whether for creative expression, personal fulfillment, or social interaction, the digital worlds we make have profound repercussions that we are still learning to manage and understand. As we get more familiar with digital spaces and better at integrating them into ourlives, we confront new dimensions of our humanity and confront new levels of challenges with our connection with technology. As we consider our changing relationships with these digital spaces, it becomes obvious that we are always going to have to adapt, in an attempt to comprehend and control the far-reaching consequences of our technical creations. We are always going to have to keep up. We have created something that continuously proves to be something bigger than all of us.

            <h2>The web is what we make it. -Schwulst</h2>
            <p>
                As I reflect on our increasing reliance on digital spaces, I am hopeful that we can adopt a more thoughtful approach to both using and creating technology. It is important to have conversations about why we design technology and how it shapes our lives before it becomes widely available. Currently, we see technology in two main ways: as a mere tool, like a machine that assists us in our everyday, or as something that enhances the way we connect and care for each other. Considering it from this perspective helps us understand how design choices can either isolate us or bring us closer together. As we navigate the digital worlds we continue to create, we must carefully consider how the design of technology impacts our relationships and what it means for our shared humanity.
