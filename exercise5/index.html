                <h3>Growth as a Creative Person:</h3>
                <p>The web design skills we covered have definitely helped me grow as a creative person.  Learning about visual hierarchy and user experience (UX) has given me a new set of skills I can pull from when expressing my ideas.  It's not just about making things look pretty anymore; it's about crafting a user journey that's both beautiful and functional.  This applies not just to websites, but to any creative project I undertake.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Satisfaction with Work:</h3>
                <p>I am absolutely happy with not only my work but also my progress. Looking back at the beginning of the semester, I can see a huge leap in my skills.  Even this final exercise is something I'm genuinely proud of, and it shows how much I've learned.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Shifting Views:</h3>
                <p>This class has definitely changed my views on technology and visual culture.  It's opened my eyes to the artistry and thoughtfulness that goes into good web design.  Websites aren't just passive platforms anymore; they're interactive experiences that can be incredibly creative.</p>
                <h3>Future Plans:</h3>
                <p>The skills I've gained are incredibly valuable and will undoubtedly play a role in my creative endeavors.  I'm particularly drawn to the world of front-end design, where I can combine my newfound coding knowledge with my creative sensibilities.  Being able to translate a design vision into a functional and visually appealing website experience is incredibly exciting. These skills have opened up a whole new avenue for creative expression, and I'm eager to see where it takes me.</p>
                <h3>Closing Remarks:</h3>
                <p>In closing, this web design course has been an eye-opening journey for me as a creative individual. It's introduced me to a new world of expression and exploration. Through each exercise, I've witnessed remarkable growth in my skills and confidence. I'm genuinely proud of the progress I've made and the work I've produced. Looking ahead, I'm excited to continue refining my skills, particularly in front-end design. I'm grateful for the encouragement of our professor and the support of my classmates, making this the most rewarding coding class I've taken at Fordham. Thank you all for an unforgettable experience.</p>
