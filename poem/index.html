        <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
        <h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
        <p class="first">
            Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
            And sorry I could not travel both<br>
            And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
            And looked down one as far as I could<br>
            To where it bent in the undergrowth;
        </p>
        <p class="second">
            Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
            And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
            Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
            Though as for that the passing there<br>
            Had worn them really about the same,
        </p>
        <p class="third">
            And both that morning equally lay<br>
            In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
            Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
            Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
            I doubted if I should ever come back.
        </p>
        <p class="fourth">
            I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
            Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
            Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-<br>
            I took the one less traveled by,<br>
            And that has made all the difference.
        </p>
